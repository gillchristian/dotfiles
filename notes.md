### Rust & OpenSSL

OpenSSL v3.x.x doesn't work with Rust.

The steps from <https://askubuntu.com/a/1407024> > _Old version of this article_

This also required pointing Rust to the right directory

```sh
OPENSSL_DIR=/usr/local/ssl cargo build --release
```

There was another OpenSSL problem.

```
libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

```bash
wget http://nz2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb
```

### Key bindings

To set the AltGr modifier for Intl characters (like `Ã±`) I the following works:

_Settings > keyboard > + > English (United States) > "English (intl., with AltGr dead keys)"_

And for making Caps Lock to be Ctrl

### Installing AppImage as desktop apps

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) provides an `AppImage` format for their installation.

The file can be executed directly and it will run the program, but it won't show as an application.

Adding a `.desktop` file to `~/.local/share/applications` solves the problem.

Here's the file:

```toml
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Obsidian
Comment="A second brain, for you, forever."
Icon=/home/bb8/Applications/Obsidian/icon.png
Exec=/home/bb8/Applications/Obsidian/obsidian
Terminal=false
```

To validate and install the file run:

```bash
$ desktop-file-validate ~/.local/share/applications/Obsidian.desktop
$ sudo update-desktop-database
```
